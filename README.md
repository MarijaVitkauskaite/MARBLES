#### Dont lose them!

This app was created to help neurodivergent people maintain the most basic every day habits such as brushing teeth or taking a shower. 

The main feature of this application is the horizontally scrolable calendar, where the user can add new habits and edit existing ones: update every day status, delete (see in the video below).
